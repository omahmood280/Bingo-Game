# Bingo Game

The goal of this project was to create a menu-driven text-based limited implementation of a bingo game. I have always been passionate about gaming so I really liked the idea of doing a bingo game. 

It's a limited implementation so in particular there will be no randomisation of numbers and shouting out.

To develop this project, I used Java 17 on IntelliJ IDEA.
